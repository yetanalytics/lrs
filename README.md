# com.yetanalytics/lrs

[![CI](https://github.com/yetanalytics/lrs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yetanalytics/lrs/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.yetanalytics/lrs.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.yetanalytics/lrs)

Yet Analytics Core LRS Library. Includes protocols and functions used to implement a conformant [xAPI Learning Record Store](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec).

## Usage

This project is set up to use the `clj`/`clojure` executable and `deps.edn`, with a handy `Makefile`.

To use the dev profile, which contains all dev/repl/test stuff, use the `:dev` alias: `-A:dev`.

`Makefile` targets of note:

* `clean` - Clean all build/ephemeral files. Note that this includes node_modules and package.json but not package-lock.json.
* `node_modules` - As a convenience, have `cljs.main` figure out the node deps in `src/main/deps.cljs` and upstream, and pull them. You'll want this before using something like CIDER.
* `repl` - Run a Clojure repl with the `:dev` alias.
* `repl-cljs` - Run a Clojurescript node repl.
* `run-dev` - Start an in-memory implementation of the LRS in Clojure.
* `run-dev-cljs` - Start an in-memory implementation of the LRS in ClojureScript.
* `test-lib-clj` - Run the tests in Clojure.
* `test-lib-cljs` - Run the tests in ClojureScript.
* `test-lib` - Run the tests on both Clojure and ClojureScript.
* `test-conformance-clj-sync` - Run ADL LRS Conformance Test Suite on a synchronous Clojure LRS on the JVM.
* `test-conformance-clj-async` - Run ADL LRS Conformance Test Suite on an asynchronous Clojure LRS on the JVM.
* `test-conformance-cljs` - Run ADL LRS Conformance Test Suite on an (always asynchronous) ClojureScript LRS on node.
* `test-conformance` - Run all conformance tests.
* `test-all` - Run all lib and conformance tests.

## Implementation Notes

### Async `GET /statements` Error Handling

LRS Applications implementing the `com.yetanalytics.lrs.protocol/-get-statements-async` method return a channel containing results. Since the body is streamed it is not possible to change the status of the request if an error is encountered. Applications can immediately terminate the stream (resulting in a malformed body) by passing `:com.yetanalytics.lrs.protocol/async-error` to the channel. This is preferable to returning a structurally valid response that is missing data. See [this PR](https://github.com/yetanalytics/lrs/pull/78) for more information.

### Statement Attachment Handling & Normalization

#### `PUT/POST /statements`

xAPI clients can send statement data with arbitrary file attachments using the `multipart/mixed` Content-Type [per the spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#requirements-for-attachment-statement-batches). An attachment referenced in an xAPI statement (or substatement) that does not have a `fileUrl` property must be included *at least once* in the request body as a part identified by hash. In practice this means that duplicate attachments may be present on the request. `lrs` will normalize/deduplicate attachments before sending them to implementation code such that every attachment in the list has a distinct hash. See [this PR](https://github.com/yetanalytics/lrs/pull/81) for more information.

Note that requests containing attachments *not* referenced in statement data will fail with a 400 status.

#### `GET /statements`

LRS implementations should return attachments in the same normalized form mentioned above, though this is not checked or enforced by `lrs`.

## Bench Testing

Facilities to bench test any LRS with [DATASIM](https://github.com/yetanalytics/datasim) are available. For instance, to bench the in-memory LRS:

    $ make run-dev

And in another terminal:

    $ clojure -Abench -m com.yetanalytics.lrs.bench http://localhost:8080/xapi -s 1000 -b 100

This will bench the LRS with 1000 statements in POST batches of 100.
